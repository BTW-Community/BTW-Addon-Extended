Version 1.1.0
The villager changes in this version required me to split villager professions into their own entities. Backwards compatibility has been added for villagers in the old format, though it is still a good idea to back up your worlds.
However, support cannot be added for going the other way. Worlds which update to this version of the API cannot be downgraded safely. If you do load a world that you have loaded with this version later with a version of the API before 1.1.0, or without the API, your villagers will disappear.
Back up your worlds just in case!
